I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Technology at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Yulun Zhang](https://yulunzhang.com/). My research interests mainly focus on model lightweighting, such as quantization and pruning of large language models, as well as kv cache compression.
